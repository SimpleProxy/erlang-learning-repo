        Here are some toy projects and exercices just for the
    sake of learning Erlang. The language has many interesting
    features and I am looking forward to it.
        The files in this repository may be too much verbose and
    that is on porpuse as my intention is to learn and maybe 
    even help someone looking for simple code to learn something
    new too.


     bool.erl           boolean functions
     tree.erl           a simple tree implementation
     recursive.erl      some recursive functions with lists
     tailrec.erl        tail recursive functions with lists
     sort.erl           merge sort implementation in erlang
     map.erl            maps and folds functions
     exits.erl          functions using exits
     calc.erl           reverse polish notation calculator
     echo.erl           simple module that sends messages to it self
     concurrent.erl     
     state.erl          module that receive and retrieves states/messages
     road.txt           text file wiht the paths to shortpath.erl
