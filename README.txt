                        LEARNING ERLANG

        Here are some toy projects and exercices just for the
    sake of learning Erlang. The language has many interesting
    features and I am looking forward to it.
        The files in this repository may be too much verbose and
    that is on porpuse as my intention is to learn and document it
    to my best, maybe even help someone looking for simple code to
    learn something new too.
